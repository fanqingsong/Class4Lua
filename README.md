# Class4Lua

a lightweight object oriented programming tool of lua language 

Because Lua is Object-based Object Oriented Programming language, so there isn't class keyword for usage.
The repo tries to give a simple solution to mimic class.

Compared to other implementation, 
https://github.com/Yonaba/Lua-Class-System
It has special features:
(1) virtual class declaration
(2) single-instance declaration
(3) frozen for class. once frozen, the class properties cannot be changed.
